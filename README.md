# Project Description:
A delibertely useless notepad that erases your writing as you go.It's a race against your own memory.
Try and watch your words fade away.Its the art of forgetting in action.

# The Problem (that doesn't exist):
People are remembering too much.There's a desperate need for a notepad that deletes thoughts as they are typed.This project is to promote true forgetfulness and prevent dangerous levels of productivity.

# The Solution (that nobody asked for):
Introducing a notepad that does the exact opposite of what it's meant to do - A notepad that erases your text as you type.No saving,no memory,just pure,beautiful nonsense.
